### Music Player App
This code is for a basic music player that handles audio playback in a web environment. It lets users interact with the audio player by controlling the playback (play/pause), skipping to the next or previous track, and visualizing the song's progress. The player also updates and displays the songâ€™s title, artist, and album cover dynamically.

Made with javascript.
